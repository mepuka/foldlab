# packages/plait — decisions the spine spec did not fix

Task-local placeholders per the numbering rule in `proto/DECISIONS.md`;
repository D-numbers are assigned at merge.

### T0. DEV-711 register mapping and replay wall

Decided: `Register.ts` owns the public `Registers` service and
`src/internal/registers.ts` owns NATS KV. The token is the key's revision-CAS
order. Commit stores the lease token in its terminal payload even though the
storing PUT advances the backing stream revision; observe reports the landed
lease token. `flb-fab-reg` is file-backed R=1, history 64, TTL 0, max bytes -1.
Every generated row audits its history for at most one landing and no zombie.
Row isolation is one fresh server — a fresh backing-stream incarnation — per
row, the Go wall's shape; bucket destroy+recreate is never an isolation
primitive (it is the seam-rule-7 incarnation edge, and building on it made
the round-1 wall nondeterministic). The wall's numeric token equality with
the model counter is an artifact of that envelope (one key, fresh server);
an interleaved-writer wall must assert order-isomorphism instead. Failed CAS
appends are classified by operation context plus code and reconciled by
read-back comparison, never by expecting a duplicate PubAck; transport
causes are preserved and never wear fencing laws. The hard-kill wall reuses
`zombie-stale-commit`: TS grants, Go steals, the TS zombie refuses, and Go
lands the current-token outcome. The runtime mutant is the real commit path
with its token comparison deleted, run against the live bucket, killed by
the `zombie-stale-commit` vector with its executed trace committed
(`negative-controls/stale-token-mutant.trace.json`); the Lean gate kills
hand-edited corpus rows by byte comparison. **Load-bearing? yes** — this
is the concrete F5-to-KV mapping and its executable wall.

### T1. Build the pinned upstream NATS server command from the Go module lock

Decided: the round-trip harness builds `github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2`
from `go/go.mod` into a temporary directory, then launches that binary with
JetStream enabled, one replica, and a file-backed temporary store.
Alternatives: download a release archive during every test; check a binary
into the repository; wrap the server library in a new local command. Why: the
repository already pins and verifies `v2.14.4` in its Go module, so building
the upstream command uses an existing checksum-locked source without adding a
binary artifact or a second launcher implementation. **Load-bearing? yes** —
the round trip is evidence only for the exact server version it launches.

### T2. The NATS payload is the canonical envelope bytes

Decided: publish the canonical UTF-8 envelope bytes directly and put the same
envelope digest in `Nats-Msg-Id`; consumers constrained-decode those bytes and
re-derive the digest. Alternatives: an outer JSON frame; compression before
publish. Why: the envelope is already a complete data boundary, and an outer
transport frame would create a second representation with no slice-0 consumer.
Compression remains transport-only and is exercised as a killed wall mutant.
**Load-bearing? no** — a later transport dress may change without moving
identity, provided its decoder yields the same canonical envelope bytes.

### T3. Reach the canonicalizer through the workspace package specifier

Decided: declare `@foldlab/core: workspace:*` and import
`@foldlab/core/jcs`. Alternatives: a relative reach into
`../../core/src/jcs.js`; copying the canonicalizer. Why: the package cannot run
without the estate-owned RFC 8785 seam, and the workspace dependency plus
exports map makes that fact visible to tooling without widening G7's external
dependency ceiling. **Load-bearing? yes** — bypassing or hiding this seam makes
the package's identity authority inaccurate.

### T4. Verified reads use an ephemeral ordered JetStream consumer

Decided: `FabricClient.subscribe` creates a subject-filtered ordered consumer
with `DeliverPolicy.All`, adapts its synchronous callback through
`Stream.callback`, and deletes it with the surrounding scope. Alternatives: a
core NATS interest subscription; a named durable consumer. Why: the round trip
must read the frames stored by the exact file-backed R=1 stream, including when
the publisher has exited, while slice 0 owns no durable cursor or resumption
policy. The callback adapter lets interruption close an idle message pump.
**Load-bearing? yes** — core interest delivery would leave storage and replica
shape outside the evidence path.

### T5. Pin the message-id duplicate window explicitly

Decided: the slice-0 stream declares a two-minute (`120_000_000_000` ns)
duplicate window and the shape check requires it. Alternatives: inherit the
server default; expose a caller option. Why: `PublishedEnvelope.duplicate` is a
public consequence of digest-as-message-id, so its time bound must not move
silently with a server default. **Load-bearing? yes** — the window defines the
bounded interval over which a repeated envelope is one stored frame.

### T6. The incarnation pin at register-open is deferred, recorded

Decided: the register does NOT yet record the backing stream's creation time
at open or refuse on its mismatch. Every register claim therefore carries the
bound "within a fixed backing-stream incarnation; administrative lifecycle
mutation is outside the credential guard" (module JSDoc, both CONTEXT files,
both READMEs, and the proposed ledger row). Alternatives: a per-operation
stream-info comparison (one extra round trip per action); external pin
storage (new machinery no consumer asked for); epoch-bearing tokens (ruled
OUT for v0 by the seam-rule-7 ruling). Why: a pin held only inside the
bucket dies with the bucket, so a real guard needs either per-operation
verification cost or cross-process state — both are un-grilled machinery;
the ruling explicitly admits a recorded deferral, and the DEV-716 ACL suite
(application credentials cannot delete or recreate streams and buckets) is
the other half of the guard. **Load-bearing? yes** — until the pin or the
ACL suite lands, the bound sentence is the only fence around lifecycle
mutation.

### T7. Inspect every emitted overload signature through the compiler API

Decided: the public-effect gate emits the package declarations, asks the pinned
TypeScript compiler for every call signature, checks each resolved return error
against `Refusal`, and byte-diffs a generated signature manifest. Alternatives:
continue using `ReturnType`, which resolves only the last signature; encode a
two-, three-, and four-overload inference ladder. Why: TypeScript exposes no
general type-level reflection over an overload set, and a count-bounded ladder
would reproduce the hand-maintained escape shape the derived gate replaced.
**Load-bearing? yes** — `retryAbsence` is the first live four-signature export,
and every non-final signature was otherwise outside the gate.

### T8. Bound authored-surface recursion at eight edges

Decided: the type-level public-surface walk stops after eight recursive edges,
traverses plain classes including their prototype and statics, and subtracts
only the imported `Schema.Top` protocol before traversing package-authored
Schema extensions. The controls add a fallible static and a fallible `decode`
to new surfaces, so both former blanket exemptions are under the quantifier.
Alternatives: leave recursion unbounded; suppress every `ast` carrier; suppress
every constructor. The review's removal test at `2853e48` was: both blanket
arms removed → `TS2589`; `ast` only → clean; constructor only → clean. Why: the
explicit counter covers the shipped namespace depth and the planted deep-object
shape without asking TypeScript to expand cyclic vendor protocols indefinitely.
**Load-bearing? yes** — removing the counter reintroduces `TS2589`, while either
blanket arm restores a live escape.
